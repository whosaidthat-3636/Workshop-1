# Workshop-1
- The idea for this particular workshop is to mimic a pool table, everytime the page is refreshed/played with random numbers of balls will appear at random placements

With this, I was only getting mere flahses of color everytime. My mistake was having the background fill in the draw function as it would draw OVER the balls.

But I also wanted to keep the ball at a constant scale so that it reflects more like a game of pool. This was a simple fix as all I had to do was change the value of the scale rather than leaving it at a random.
